# Events System Implementation Plan
**Date:** 2025-11-11

## Problem Analysis
- Root folder contains `models_events.md` with events data for each model
- Need to create `src/data/models_events.js` organizing events by model IDs from existing `models.js`  
- On `ModelPage.jsx`, add "Events" button in `model-header-section` to show popup with model's events

## Solution Approach

### Stage 1: Data Analysis
- Analyze `models_events.md` structure and content
- Examine `models.js` for model IDs and data structure
- Review `ModelPage.jsx` to understand current UI and locate `model-header-section`

### Stage 2: Data Structure Creation
- Create `models_events.js` with events organized by model ID
- Structure: `{ modelId: [{ title, description, details }] }`

### Stage 3: UI Component Development  
- Create reusable popup component for events display
- Ensure responsive and accessible design

### Stage 4: Integration
- Add Events button to `model-header-section`
- Implement popup state management
- Connect button to show relevant model's events

## Detailed Todo List
1. Read and analyze models_events.md file structure - **Done**
2. Read models.js to understand model IDs and structure - **Done**
3. Read ModelPage.jsx to find model-header-section - **Done**
4. Create models_events.js with events organized by model ID - **Done**
5. Create EventsPopup component for displaying events - **Done**
6. Add Events button to model-header-section in ModelPage.jsx - **Done**
7. Implement popup state management and event display logic - **Done**
8. Test the functionality - **Done**

## Technical Considerations
- Events data structured as object with model IDs as keys for efficient lookup
- Popup should be responsive and accessible
- Check for existing modal/popup system for consistency
- Events button only shows if model has associated events
- Maintain consistent code style with existing project
